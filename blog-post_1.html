					<p>The “State of JavaScript 2019” report offers a glimpse into the future of frontend development.
						In this article, we’ll review the report, break down key takeaways, and explore some frameworks
						that are poised to take center stage in 2020.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">What is the ‘State of JavaScript?</h3>
					<p> The “State of JavaScript” report is an annual survey that records and — thanks to guest data
						visualization expert Amelia Wattenberger — beautifully illustrates the opinions of more than
						21,000 developers around the world. First issued in 2016 by designer and developer Sacha Grief,
						the latest edition covers frontend web development frameworks, databases, state management,
						relationships between frameworks, reception and ease of use, languages that compile to
						JavaScript, mobile frameworks, build tools, JavaScript testing tools, and a whole lot more.

						In my opinion, the “State of JavaScript” report is the first JS-only developer survey to gain
						universal respect in the JavaScript community. Other popular resources include StackOverflow’s
						annual developer survey and Jetbrain’s “State of Developer Ecosystem” report, which query
						roughly 90,000 and 7,000 respondents, respectively.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Top frontend development frameworks</h3>
					<p>To start, let’s take a look at the most in-demand frontend development frameworks based on
						factors such as awareness, overall happiness, usage by company size and salary range, show of
						interest, ease of use, and reach.</p>
					<h4 class="mt-5">React JS</h4>
					<img class="img-fluid py-4" src="assets/images/blog/blog1/react-js-banner.png"
						alt="react banner"></a>
					<p>According to the report, React is a “declarative, efficient, and flexible
						JavaScript library for building user interfaces.” Built by Facebook, React makes it simple
						to create interactive user interfaces. The framework is designed for building
						component-centric applications and with backward compatibility in mind, so you can rest
						assured of its longevity. React has almost 3 million users and a massive developer
						community.

						The “State of JavaScript” survey revealed a surge in interest retention from 64 percent to
						71 percent over a 12-month period. On the flip side, the number of respondents who do not
						want to use react again increased by 2 percent. Virtually every JavaScript developer has
						heard about React, and the percentage of developers who are not interested decreased from 9
						percent to 7 percent this year.
					</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5">Vue JS</h4>
					<img class="img-fluid py-4" src="assets/images/blog/blog1/vue_banner.png" alt="vue banner"></a>
					<p>Vue.js is a very progressive framework for building user interfaces. It
						consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only and an
						ecosystem of supporting libraries to help you tackle complexity in large single-page
						applications. Evan You created Vue with the help of hundreds community members, and
						developers have used the framework in nearly 1.2 million projects, according to GitHub data.

						Vue.js experienced massive growth in the last 12 months, and the survey data suggests the
						knowledge gap is closing: 34 percent of developers want to learn Vue, down from 47 percent
						in the previous report — an indication that many developers have gone from wanting to learn
						the framework to actually using it. In addition, retention rates skyrocketed from 28 percent
						to a whopping 40 percent.

						By now, most JavaScript developers have heard of Vue.js. There is still a knowledge gap and
						a lack of beginner content, but the Vue team and community seem to be on top of those minor
						drawbacks. In fact, the composition API forthcoming in Vue 3 could help alleviate these
						concerns.
					</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5">Angular JS</h4>
					<img class="img-fluid py-4" src="assets/images/blog/blog1/angular_banner.png"
						alt="angular banner"></a>
					<p>Google’s Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the
						web, mobile, and desktop. The framework combines declarative templates, dependency
						injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development
						challenges. It has a useful CLI, so beginners can easily get started. There is even a GUI
						client called Console.

						Angular did not have a great year for retention. Compared to last year, the survey revealed
						a 2 percent drop in the number of people who have used and would continue to use Angular.
						The overall interest level in Angular also dropped by about 1 percent. Will the fast and
						lightweight Ivy renderer forthcoming in Angular 9 help boost the interest level among
						JavaScript developers?
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5">Preact JS</h3>
					<img class="img-fluid py-4" src="assets/images/blog/blog1/preact_banner.jpeg"
						alt="preact banner"></a>
					<p>Preact is a JavaScript library that is branded a faster 3kB alternative to
						React JS that uses the same modern browser API with structures like components and a virtual
						DOM. More than 18,000 projects use Preact, and it has nearly 25,000 stars on GitHub.

						Preact has experienced a good level of growth since last year, with retention rate up to 9
						percent from 6 percent last year. Awareness has also risen; the number of people who have
						not heard of the library fell from 28 percent to 24 percent in the last 12 months.
					</p>

					<h4 class="mt-5">Svelte JS</h4>
					<img class="img-fluid py-4" src="assets/images/blog/blog1/svelte_banner.png"
						alt="svelte banner"></a>
					<p>Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas
						traditional frameworks such as React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser,
						Svelte shifts that work to a compile step that happens when you build your app. Instead of
						using techniques such as virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the
						DOM when the state of your app changes.

						This year, Svelte became one of the top six JS frontend libraries, with nearly 45 percent of
						developers indicating an interest to learn it. The report’s authors also named Svelte the
						winner of its “Prediction Award,” recognizing the library for its “explosive debut” in 2019.
