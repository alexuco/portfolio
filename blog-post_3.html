					<p>Thanks to training and full-stack developer Bootcamp, developers can venture into various areas
						of web development. Long gone are those days when web developers only code in one language.
						Today, full-stack developers are the hottest thing. Why? Because of the more skills, you have
						nowadays, the more valuable you are, and the higher you will earn.

						So what’s a full stack developer, and how can you become one?</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote m-lg-5 py-3 pl-4 px-lg-5">
						<p class="mb-2">A full-stack developer is someone conversant in both front-end and back-end
							parts of a web
							application and other areas like databases, designing, version system control, etc.

							One doesn’t necessarily have to be an expert in all areas to be considered a full stake
							developer. You need to be knowledgeable of the various technologies involved and their
							applications. Below are some of the skills required.</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Skills Required to Become A Full-Stack Web Developer</h3>
					<p>There are various skills a developer must have obtained to be considered a full stack
						developer. These skills are essential to be able to understand the environment and can be
						obtained through training or full-stack developer bootcamp.</p>

					<h4 class="my-3">Front End Development</h4>
					<p>The front-end is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with. Like
						on this website, the various structures you see, including the content you are reading now,
						is the front end.</p>


					<h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">The front-end cycles around various technologies, like so:</h5>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2">HTML5 - CSS</li>
						<p class="mb-2">You must have heard about HTML and CSS, even as a newbie in web
							development. HTML is a tool
							that allows you to add content to a website. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), on the other
							hand, allows you to ‘style’ the content. Knowledge of both technologies is essential to
							become a full-stack developer.

							You should also learn about bootstrap, which can also be utilized for the design and
							layout of web content.</p>

						<li class="mb-2">Javascript</li>
						<p class="mb-2">JavaScript is a popular language that is used for both front-end and back-end
							development.
							Knowledge of JavaScript is a must to become a full-stack developer. It applies to web
							browsers and is a server-side language.

							You should have a good knowledge of various aspects of JavaScript, including JSON, Control
							Flow, Promises, Callback, testing frameworks, how to structure and modularize codes, etc.
						</p>
						<li class="mb-2">React - Angular.js or Vue.js</li>
						<p class="mb-2">It’s also essential to learn, at least, one of the most common Javascript
							frameworks|libraries like AngularJS, React or Vue.js.

							Nowadays your are out of the game if you don't get some of those. Don't hesitate, go for it.
						</p>
					</ul>

					<h4 class="my-3">Back End Development</h4>
					<p>The back-end is the part of a web application that’s unseen and executes the command of
						the user. It handles database processes, logical processes, user validation, authentication,
						and server configuration.

						The back end is where all the core logic happens. It’s the environment where the
						programming language works and delivers to the user’s front-end.</p>


					<h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Some of the languages used in Back end development:</h5>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2">PHP</li>
						<p class="mb-2">PHP language is firstly created for making personal home pages. This is the
							reason why its name is PHP. But now it is one of the most used programming languages.

							The full form of PHP is Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a general-purpose programming
							language that runs on a server. Moreover, it is useful for creating web pages written in
							HTML.

							One of the more reasons why PHP is a popular language because it is cheap, free, and easy to
							use. So it is widely preferred by beginners.

							Most of the web developer uses PHP for developing web applications.
							<a href="https://coursesity.com/best-tutorials-learn/php">Learn PHP</a> to create
							content management systems like WordPress that also work on PHP language.</p>

						<li class="mb-2">NodeJs</li>
						<p class="mb-2">NodeJs is not a programming language, but a runtime allowing the execution of
							JavaScript on the server side. Now, JavaScript which is almost as old as Java, is an
							interpreted language which has been used on the client side for quite some time, until
							Node.js came along. Node.js with its “JavaScript everywhere” concept made it possible to use
							JavaScript on the backend, too.

							Node.js was first released in 2009 and is now an open-source community project developed
							under the Node.js Foundation.</p>

						<li class="mb-2">Java</li>
						<p class="mb-2">You must hear about java language, whether you are in the development field or
							not. This is the reason why java is the most popular programming language.

							Java language was created by James Gossling in 1991. Java has a JVM (java virtual machine)
							feature. Due to this feature, the program made by java language is cross-platform
							compatible.

							Java is 99% object orient based language. Moreover, Java uses automatic garbage collection
							and memory allocation feature.

							Many people believe Java is not a king after the release of the Kotlin language, but it is
							not valid. There are still many developers who
							<a href="https://coursesity.com/best-tutorials-learn/java">learn java</a> and use java for
							developing new programs.</p>

						<li class="mb-2">Python</li>
						<p class="mb-2">
							If anyone is thinking of making his career in back end development, then they must go for
							python language. The <a href="https://coursesity.com/best-tutorials-learn/python">best
								Python Tutorials</a> list is a useful resource to start learning python. Moreover,
							the python language is beneficial for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,
							Robotics, and Big Data.
						</p>

						<li class="mb-2">Ruby</li>
						<p class="mb-2">Like PHP, Ruby is also facing tough competition from JavaScript and even Python
							to establish as back-end web development programming language. So, again for web development
							javascript and Python server-side (Flask, Django, etc.) would be a good choice and will
							offer more domain flexibility than Ruby.</p>

						<li class="mb-2">Golang</li>
						<p class="mb-2">Go is also a language like Python. So the people who love Python also love to
							use this language.
							Go language is developed by Google.

							Go is a simple language, but it is more efficient as compared to C++. Moreover, Go provides
							features to write concurrent programs.

							Go language is mainly useful for building large scale and complex applications. start to
							<a href="https://coursesity.com/best-tutorials-learn/golang">Learn Go Programming</a> -
							a most demanding programming language of 2020.
						</p>


						<blockquote class="blockquote m-lg-5 py-3 pl-4 px-lg-5">
							<p class="mb-2">Both front end development and back end development have a full role of its
								own. However, knowledge of both areas is required to become a full stack developer.</p>
						</blockquote>


						<h4 class="my-3">Databases</h4>
						<p>When working on a web application, you may, at some point, need to store data like images
							or text. This makes a knowledge of databases and storage an essential skill for a full
							stake developer. You should understand relational data like SQL as well as NoSQL databases
							like MongoDB. You should also be knowledgeable about web storage, data caching, and others.
						</p>

						<h4 class="my-3">Version Control System</h4>
						<p>A Version control system records the changes made to an application over time so that a
							specific version can be easily recalled. Most applications today come in various
							versions.
							So if a particular version of the app needs to be recalled, the developer will have to
							apply the knowledge of data control.

							Git is a type of version control system that allows developers to track the changes made
							to a specific application. With Git, you can quickly identify the code you have missed and
							update the app in part or full.

							Other areas you should learn include HTTP, REST, web application architecture, and basic
							algorithms & data structures. While all these may seem complicated at first, attending a
							Full stack developer Bootcamp will improve your understanding - whether you are a
							beginner, a back-end or front-end developer seeking to transit into a full-stack developer.
						</p>


						<p>I know right; another set of complex technologies.

							Phew! Well, not to worry, everything seems complex from the outlook, but it becomes easy
							when you dive deep into it. A Full stack developer Bootcamp will make you knowledgeable
							about the process in no time.</p>

						<h4 class="my-3">Start Learning</h4>

						<p>Web development is quite broad, and it’s difficult to be knowledgeable in every aspect.
							It’s, however, essential to keep learning new things every day. While this article may point
							you towards the necessary skill needed to become a full-stack programmer, attending an
							online full stack developer Bootcamp will make you understand the various processes in no
							time.</p>



						<h4 class="my-3">Get Practical Exposure</h4>

						<p>After learning, the next step is to practice what you have learned. Undertake various
							projects to familiarize yourself with code structuring, the hosting environment, and data
							structuring. Build full-stack projects in your company. If you are unemployed, try some
							freelance jobs, join volunteer groups, reach out to businesses and individuals who need a
							website to gain experience, and build a portfolio.</p>


						<h4 class="my-3">Conclusion</h4>
						<p>Learn as you go, get further training on any aspect you think you have inefficient
							knowledge. The journey to becoming a full-stack provider may look complicated, but as you
							garner the necessary experience, the processes become easier.</p>
