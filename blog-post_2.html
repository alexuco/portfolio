					<p>Globalization has affected many aspects of our life and work is one of them. In an interconnected
						world, traditional work is an obsolete concept. Today there are many teams that work from
						different places, and even from different countries.

						Working remotely with a team is a challenge, we will not deny it. But it is possible to do it
						efficiently and the truth is that you get productivity to work will increase exponentially.
						Think about the savings in travel, time and the improvement of the quality of life of remote
						work.</p>
					<p>
						One of the great challenges of working remotely with a team is how to organize. There are many
						questions that must be answered: what tools to use, how to communicate, how to monitor work, how
						to manage projects that involve several people ... There are many more resources than you might
						feel at first sight and in fact There are many companies that have incorporated working online
						as a partial practice within the day of their workers and the tools in the cloud that allow
						proper management of such work not to grow.

						Many companies have been created with several partners working from different places and have
						achieved large-scale invoices and more and more digital nomads are traveling around the world
						while doing their work from a computer. The examples are many and disparate but they tell us
						that working remotely is not only possible but in fact it is much more beneficial for both
						parties. You earn in quality of life, you save costs and ultimately you win in happiness and
						efficiency.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why does remote work make you happier and more efficient?</h3>
					<p> Maybe if you hear that remote work makes us happier and more efficient, it seems at least a
						well-meaning assumption. But in reality we can say that we are talking about a proven fact. Take
						for example this study by a Standford professor and published by the National Bureau of Economic
						Research. This study took 250 volunteers who worked in the same company, half did it from home
						and the other half went to the offices. The study was carried out for 9 months and these were
						the results that were obtained:</p>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2">The company CTrip, saved about $ 2000 per year for each employee in working
							space
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Employees who worked from home were 13.5% more efficient than those who worked
							from the office
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Workers who performed remote work were more committed to their employment,
							specifically 9% more than the rest
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Workers who stayed at home became less sick and asked for fewer permits
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">The attrition rate was 50% better for workers who had chosen to work from home
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">And although happiness is difficult to measure, what we can say is that
							employees who worked from home reported greater satisfaction with their employment than
							those who did it from the company's offices</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Although it is a concrete study and with a sample that can be considered small, the truth is that
						everything indicates that work from home allows you to work efficiently. The advantages are
						clear, and not only for workers but also for the company.</p>
					<br>
					<h5 class="my-3">But why does working from home make us happier and more efficient?</h5>
					<blockquote class="blockquote m-lg-5 py-3 pl-4 px-lg-5">
						<p class="mb-2">
							Because it avoids distractions and unproductive conversations that are the order of the day
							in the office. And because it allows us to better reconcile family and work life and saves
							us expenses and travel time.
							This study is not the only one, the results of this experiment are very similar to another
							Gallup study, according to which employees who work from home are much more predisposed
							(41%) than the rest (30%) to develop engagement with the business.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of course, not everything was going to be positive, remote work requires a series of
						characteristics to be productive. The most important thing is to avoid the bed, the fridge and
						the TV, the three biggest threats we have at home. It is very important to have created a
						workspace, discipline and communication tools to be able to work in a team. But we will see all
						this in the advice section in which we will help you with tips so that working from home becomes
						a dream and not a nightmare.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why should work from home be a common practice in companies?</h3>
					<p>Work in an office for 8 hours a day is starting to become obsolete. A worker who performs his
						work from home saves costs for the company and for himself, while improving his productivity and
						his quality of life. It seems proven that absenteeism is reduced and employee turnover
						decreases, something that greatly affects productivity in a company.
					</p>


					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Company benefits</h3>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2">Cost reduction per employee in workspace
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Decrease of sick leave or own affairs
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Greater engagement with the employees' company
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Increased employee productivity
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Workers stay longer in the company, reducing turnover
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2">More possibilities in the selection of personnel, with remote work distance is
							no longer a problem</li>
						<li class="mb-2">We can hire the best professionals regardless of whether they live in the city
							where the company is based or not</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Worker benefits</h3>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2">Important savings in transport costs, clothing and other expenses (so they have
							a better perception of the salary received)</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Time savings, in large cities, travel can be up to 20% of the effective daily
							working day</li>
						<li class="mb-2">Better family reconciliation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Some large companies such as Basecamp, Buffer, Zapier or Help Scout operate with 100% of their
						staff remotely, demonstrating that this model is possible. Other companies such as Dell, Oracle,
						Adobe or Salesforce have a mixed model, with an important part of their templates working from
						home. The digital economy is a clearly booming value and more and more companies are welcoming
						this model of distance work.</p>
